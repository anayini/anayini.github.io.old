      <description>My first contribution to the Swift programming language was merged earlier this year. Despite the simplicity of the bug I fixed, the process took awhile and I learned a good deal in the process. This post will briefly go over the fix I made and some give some advice for future contributors.
After deciding to contribute I browsed the Swift Jira to find a suitable beginner bug. The first thing I did was filter for issues within the Standard Library and the Swift Package Manager.</description>

      <description>I was recently working on a project where I encountered a bit of slow down in debugging some API calls. The project can be simplified as grabbing data from a new API, parsing and persisting the data, and rendering it in a UITableView.
In this particular case, the development of the backend API was being done by a separate set of people and was using a new backend infrastructure separate from the old API infrastructure.</description>

      <description>It is a hot, humid morning on Phuket&amp;rsquo;s Soi Tai-ed, what has been called a mecca for &amp;ldquo;fitness holidays&amp;rdquo;. All year round, foreigners come here from all over the world to spend anywhere from weeks to months getting in shape. This single street has dozens of gyms and studios with people learning everything from weightlifting to yoga to MMA. Still, the street is most famous as a destination to learn Thailand&amp;rsquo;s national sport: Muay Thai.</description>
