It is a hot, humid morning on Phuket's **Soi Tai-ed**, what has been called a mecca
for "fitness holidays".  All year round, foreigners come here from all over the world
to spend anywhere from weeks to months getting in shape.  This single street has dozens
of gyms and studios with people learning everything from weightlifting to yoga to MMA.
Still, the street is most famous as a destination to learn Thailand's national sport: **Muay Thai**.

As the popularity of Muay Thai has grown outside of Thailand, a few gym sprouted up here
catering to foreigners wanting to learn the art.  What started as a couple of traditional
Muay Thai gyms has expanded into the massive destination for all things fitness that it is today.
**Phuket Dragon Muay Thai** is one of those original gyms, still only focused on teaching Thai Boxing.

### Phuket Dragon Muay Thai ###

Nestled midway through Soi Tai-ed, the gym has a pretty traditional style.  It has four rings
and two separate open air boxing areas.  Typically the front area is used for private lessons,
while the back area is used for the twice daily group lessons.  Phuket Dragon Muay Thai is owned
and run by Ekkarin Lookchan, a former Muay Thai fighter, and his family.  It has its own restaurant
where fighters can get cheap, home cooked meals after training, an equipment shop, and a handful of onsite
bungalows you can stay while you train:

### Conclusion ###

As I've checked out several of the other gyms on the street, I've noticed that Dragon is
probably one of the most traditional gyms.  It teaches Muay Thai as it is probably taught
in the rest of the country to Thais.  Many of the other gyms have caught on to the popularity
of other martials arts and fitness trends and have adapted their training and schedule to
include those offerings as well.  Dragon has stayed pretty pure.

As I'm training here, I'm very happy with the choice I've made and would recommend Dragon to
anyone wanting to train in  Thailand.

### Final Recommendations
A few final tips:

- Take private lessons and focus on the clinch.  It is really hard to get the same training outside of Thailand.
- Easy yourself into the training - moving from 3-5 hours of Muay Thai per week to 4-5 hours a day was hard on the body.
- Make sure to go along whenever someone from the gym is fighting.  Its a great experience and they appreciate the support.
