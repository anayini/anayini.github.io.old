My name is Arjun Nayini and I'm an iOS engineer based out of San Francisco.

I work for PlanGrid making construction productivity software.

Before that, I worked at Palantir on projects in health insurance,
federal government and local law enforcement and interned at Google.

Outside of software I like to practice Muay Thai, taste teas, and explore the Bay Area.
